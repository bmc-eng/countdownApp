# Countdown App
This is the application that goes with the Countdown REST API. The app allows the user to enter a list of letters and then see the possible words that contain those letters. The Countdown API service needs to be running. To get this to run, follow the instructions on this repository: https://github.com/bmc-eng/CountdownAPI

### Features in the App
Enter up to 9 letters, scroll across to enter all of the letters. Press Countdown to open the modal screen with the answers. Press each button for a definition.
